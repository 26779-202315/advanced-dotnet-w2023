A few quick notes about using Entity Framework (EF) in your Console Applications:
* First make sure that you have installed the following 2 NuGet Packages into your project.
	- Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer
	- Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Tools
* You will need to create a Database Context by inheriting from the DbContext class
	- Ex: Data > AppDbContext
* Create your models like you would create regular classes.
	- Each model that need to be transferred to the database should have a DbSet Property added to the Database Context


*** Before running any commands in Package Manager Console ***
* If you have more than one project in the solution:
- Make sure that you set the project as the startup project.
- At the top of the Package Manager Console window, set the project as the Default Project in the dropdown list.


* Database Migrations:
	- When ready, create a new database migration using the following command in the Package Manager Console:
 	add-migration <your-migration-name>
* Database update:
	- After creating migration files, move the changes to the database using the following command in the Package Manager Console:
		update-database
